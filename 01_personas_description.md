Samantha, age 20, is a junior math major at Albany State University. Samantha went to elementary through high school in south Florida and moved to Albany for an athletic scholarship to play tennis, which she values heavily. She lives on-campus and takes a mix of in-person and online classes. Ever since she began university, Samantha has always preferred taking notes digitally for convenience, especially since she types more quickly than she writes. Often, she has to attend math courses in-person when she's just come from early-morning tennis practice. Samantha has realized that she can take more notes during class if she types them, even while she's tired, and that she can transcribe other students' notes more quickly if she misses classes due to tennis matches. However, transcribing complex math equations quickly using the features in standard word processing software, such as Google Docs, is often slow and reduces the efficiency gain that pushes her to take notes digitally in the first place. This is becoming especially problematic now that the majority of her courses are upper-level math. Samantha is trying to find a note-taking app that suits her needs.
