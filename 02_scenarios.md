Jackson learned how to write during his early grade school and grew up taking notes by using paper and pen. He is now in college and as the technology evolved, Jackson preferred to use laptop computer as an educational tool, to research for his studies and also to take lecture notes. He observed that paper and pen works for a short period of time because he tends to misplace his notebook and all notes were gone. With the use of laptop, he can save his notes digitally. However, he is not utilizing it because there are multiple files saved in different folder locations. He needs a tool/application which can cater to his needs in taking lecture notes, categorize those notes, saving it, or even adding links of audio files/video files. And it will also be a good idea that he can access these notes even when using a different computer as long as there is internet.

Samantha is a junior math major studying at Albany State University. She plays tennis for her athletic scholarship, which means that she often goes to class tired after practice and that she has to miss class sometimes for games during her season. Samantha is taking Linear Algebra this semester, which requires her to write a lot of mathematical proofs, formulas, and matrices in her notes. She is also preparing for an exam the following week. Samantha often takes pictures of the whiteboard when she can't finish writing notes in time during class, so she is now going through her phone to find and collate or transcribe the pictures so that she can study. 

In the past, Samanatha would only add the pictures of the whiteboard to her digital notes because retyping formulas would take too long, but that prevents her from searching the text later on, and she also doesn't feel like she retains the information as well. Using OneTrueNote's math input function, Samantha is able to retype the formulas and proofs from her pictures relatively quickly. As she studies, she's able to search her digital notebook to return to specific topics to study them.
