Jackson learned how to write during his early grade school and grew up taking notes by using paper and pen. He is now in college and as the technology evolved, Jackson preferred to use laptop computer as an educational tool, to research for his studies and also to take lecture notes. He observed that paper and pen works for a short period of time because he tends to misplace his notebook and all notes were gone. With the use of laptop, he can save his notes digitally. However, he is not utilizing it because there are multiple files saved in different folder locations. He needs a tool/application which can cater to his needs in taking lecture notes, categorize those notes, saving it, or even adding links of audio files/video files. And it will also be a good idea that he can access these notes even when using a different computer as long as there is internet.
